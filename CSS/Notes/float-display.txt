Float : Float is used to make any element floating to the left or right side
        of screen it make element remove form actual execution and next element takes 
         up the space of floating element
         Float:left/right/none;

         we can even clear the floating element for any other element using
         clear:left/right/both

Dsiplay: display is used to arrange the element in a specific in way
         display : block --- will make the element into block so that each element
         will display in new line
         display : inline --- will make the element into inline so that each element follows
         the previous element(maintains same flow)
         but inline element cannot handle height / width / veertical margins
         display :inline-block --- works line inline but accepts height/width
         display : none -- remove the element(visiblity : hidden just hides the element)
