Media Queries : Media Queries are used for respomsiveness of the website . we can make 
               the style(CSS) works for specific widhts, eg
               large devices ----> 1400px
               laptop ----> 1280px
               desktop ----> 1080px to <1280px
               tablets ----> 768px to <1080px
               mobiles(landscape) ---> 576px to >768px
               mobiles(portrait) ----> 0 to <576px

 @media(min-width:1280px) and (max-width:1480){
    <!-- laptop -->
 }

             Animation-timing-function : controls the speed of animation(ease/ease-in/ease-ouy/ease-in-out/linear)
             Animation-iteration-count : number of times animation repeats (number or infinite)
             Animation-direction : decides which direction animation should run (normal/reverse/alternate/alternate-reverse)
