CSS Introduction:
  CSS stand for cascading Style Sheets. cascading refers to the Style that styles/design the layout 
  or apperance or web pages.

  CSS can be used in HTML in three ways
  1. Inline Styling.
  2. internal Styling
  3. External Styling

1. Inline Styling: it is used to apply style to a specific  element using 'style' as attribute.
  <element style="property:value;...">content</element> 

2. internal Styling: It is used to apply styles to a specific element or multiple element using
   selectors and style as an 'element'

   <style>
       selectors
       {
        property:value;......
       }
   </style> 
   Inline is the powerfull goes to internal 

3. Enternal Styling : it used to apply style to single/multiple element in a separate  file with 
   .css extension and attach it to the HTML using 'link' tag
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css"/>  

CSS styles of internal or External can override each other based on which comes last

  h1
  {
    color : red !important;
  } 

  !important > Inline > internal/External

Basic selectors : 
                  To apply style to multiple element, we need to select  the element. For that 
                  we use selectors. Most common selectors are:

           1. Tag name selector: it is used to select all element of specific rag name.

              tagname{
                property:value;
              }    

            2. Class name: 'Class' is an attribute to element which is used to select multiple element
               one element may contain multiple Class names and multiple element may contain the same class name
                 .classname{
                  property:value;
                 }

            3. id: id is used to identify an element uniquely. No teo element have same id and No element
               will contain more than one id
               #idname{
                property:value;
               }          
               id > classname > tagname (priority)

            4. universal selector: if you want apply style to all element in a webpage, you can 
               universal selector (*)
               *{
                text-align:center;
               }
